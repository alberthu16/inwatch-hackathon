Tap It. Anytime.  Anywhere.

#####What is it?
“Tap It” is an interactive, motion-based game.  Strap on an inWatchZ, listen for commands, and start tapping!  

The app gives commands one by one (punch, pull, push, twist, or drop), and the user must complete the command before time runs out.  As the game progresses, commands come faster and faster. Check out our [TapIt Video] [1]!

#####How?
We designed Tap It as a fun way to interface with smartwatches.  Most Android devices have low-level, detailed sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, and rotational vector sensors), but *how* we can utilize these sensors changes when the device is on our wrist, rather than in our hand.  

Using sensor information and a little math, we captured linear and rotational movement to distinguish between a punch, a twist, and wild user arm waving.
